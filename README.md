## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automl-churn-pipeline.git
cd automl-churn-pipeline
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train or load PyCaret model (if not already)
```python
# If not present, generate best_churn_model.pkl using PyCaret
```

### 4. Build the React frontend
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
```

> This generates a `dist/` folder used by Flask to serve static files.

### 5. Run Flask server
```bash
cd ..
python3 app.py
```

Visit the app at: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🧪 Sample Prediction Response

```json
{
  "prediction": "Yes",
  "confidence": 0.84
}
```

## 🌐 Deployment

For deployment:

- Push the entire project (Flask + built React) to a GitHub repo
- Deploy on [Railway](https://railway.app), [Render](https://render.com), or [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
- Ensure `dist/` is served by Flask in `app.py`:

```python
app = Flask(__name__, static_folder="dist", static_url_path="/")

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return app.send_static_file("index.html")
```
